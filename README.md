# PAWMATES
Pawmates is a web application constructed using create-react-app, firebase, react-bootstrap, and bulma.  Individuals can create an account and start swiping on adoptable puppies in a matter of second. We utilized the PetFinder API to pull a database of adoptable pets and the Geocode API to display the location of pet matches. Upon entering the application, users are prompted with an option to sign in or create an account. After signing in,
users will have the option to choose the location and type of pet. Visit matches page to iterate through a list of potential pawmates, 
then view saved matches in list or map section. Users will have the option to save, udpate, view, and delete their pet list.
